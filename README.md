This 2D Jump & Run Controller is designed to provide fundamental mechanics for 2D platforming games. It features smooth movement, jumping capabilities, and camera control tailored for a dynamic gameplay experience.

### Features

- **Movement:** Supports walking and running in two dimensions.
- **Jumping:** Includes single and double jumps.
- **Camera Controls:** Camera can be scrolled to prevent leap of faith situations.
- **Jump Buffer:** Temporarily stores jump input to enhance jump precision and responsiveness.

### Included Content

- **Level:** A compact course with moving platforms to test the controller's features.
- **Character:** Meet Garu`mak, the cat who demonstrates the control mechanics.

## Assets

The scene utilizes custom assets created by me. These were crafted as an exercise to develop basic skills in 2D asset creation. The music is also done by myself.
